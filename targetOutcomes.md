For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for Study 1a.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> LIB manipulation check. As expected, participants inthe favorable-LIB condition believed that Peter was more likely to be helpful in the future (M = 70.29%, SD = 23.58)than did participants in the unfavorable-LIB condition(M = 57.83%, SD = 24.08), t(86) = 2.45, p = .016, d = 0.53.Similarly, participants in the favorable-LIB condition indicatedthat Peter was less likely to be rude in the future(M = 33.67%, SD = 25.48) compared with participants inthe unfavorable-LIB condition (M = 53.93%, SD = 25.22),t(86) = 3.73, p < .001, d = 0.80.Social category inference. The primary dependentmeasure was participants’ inferences regarding the communicator’spolitical affiliation. As predicted, participantsin the favorable-LIB condition were significantly morelikely to believe that the communicator was a Democrat,and thus shared a party affiliation with the target, thanwere participants in the unfavorable-LIB condition,t(86) = 2.89, p = .005, d = 0.62 (Fig. 1). This differencewas not moderated by participants’ self-reported political-party affiliation or ideological endorsement (ps > .18).Our findings suggested initial support for our hypothesisthat individuals can infer a communicator’s social identityfrom his or her language, regardless of their own socialidentity.
